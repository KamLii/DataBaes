## Overview ##
The Databaes Team developed a database-driven web application that offers a subscription-based service to its clients. CrateUrself, offers a product to those who enjoy receiving monthly gift boxes containing various items relating to their interests. 
The specific contents of these monthly boxes are unknown to the subscriber until the point of opening, however, users have the added ability to vote on a featured item that is guaranteed to appear in their next box. 
### Specific features include: ###
- Voting system
- Discussion system
- Reporting system
- Subscription management
- Account and profile management

## Technical Details ##
CrateUrself was built using Django, a popular python-based web framework. Django supported our need for a quick and simple way to begin developing and deploying our project ideas. Built-in apps and features allowed us to easily set up essential requirements of any web application such as authentication, while third-party apps such as django-user-accounts and pinax-stripe let us handle more advanced functionalities such as profile management and payments.
The application is hosted on PythonAnywhere, a python-based web hosting service, and currently, our database backend is a MySQL server hosted on a homeserver.
